            Adolescents get just as frustrated at games as they do in life.

            When people get upset, they can act inappropriately and hurt others. Kids and young adults do this at school, during a game, and throughout their lives. When playing video games, they are just as likely to act out as if they were frustrated from a school assignment. While we don’t need doctors to help correct this, we should try to be better about expressing our problems.

            Emotional instability and mis-managing emotional responses occurs in a variety of situations: school, home, sports field, online, etc. It’s been a growing concern in video game communities and for parents who see their kids’ reactions to playing games. These researchers set out to determine if this emotional dysregulation as it relates to video games, i.e. dysregulated gaming, is worthy of clinical intervention and support. Following various research in this area, the researchers sent out a self-survey report to 1,000 adolescents and caregivers to see how the kids respond and behave while playing games and in their general lives. The researchers found that games do indeed cause these frustrations and emotional instabilities, but no more than other aspects of their lives.

            Dysregulation, aka emotional dysregulation, refers to an inability to manage emotional responses or to keep them within an acceptable range of typical emotional reactions, which include emotions like sadness, anger, irritability, and frustration. Dysregulated gaming examines this irregularity through video games and the overall psychological-need experiences gamers engage in. Three basic psychological needs that influence gaming include competence, autonomous, and relatedness. Low levels in these areas predict more dysregulation gaming whereas high levels protect against it. This study examines how dysregulated gaming accounts for emotional, peer, behavioral, or conduct problems in adolescents as in-game and daily life need frustrations connect through patterns of play.

            To achieve it’s goal, this research used a 6-pronged, theory-testing approach to identify motivational and psychological correlates of dysregulated gaming in order to determine if dysregulated gaming should be classified as a clinical disorder and what resources would facilitate it’s treatment. Through 6 hypotheses, the researchers evaluated adolescents’ dysregulated gaming relationship to basic need satisfactions and frustrations, needs experienced with games, and psychology evaluated by their caregivers.

            One thousands and four adolescents (and caregivers) completed a self-report, online survey where caregivers answered questions, followed by their children. Caregivers reported on adolescents’ social and emotional functioning. Adolescents reported on gaming activity and experiences. Adolescents who played at least one internet-based game (roughly half, e.g. ~500) answered a ‘ dysregulated gaming’ checklist that contained items such as “I felt moody or anxious when unable to play” along with a psychological-need satisfactions list that followed the same general instructions as the group-wide psychological-need satisfaction and frustration self-report but was tailored to the context of need experiences within games.

            Due to the nature of the research, there was no clear anchor to evaluate the gaming-psychological outcomes upon. The researchers used a priori power analysis to fairly test their hypotheses, and dysregulated gaming scores were more skewed and dispersed than expected. The researchers implored a number of transformative methods and sensitivity analyses to better understand the data as it related to their hypotheses.

            These findings demonstrated that daily psychological-need frustration consistently related to dysregulated gaming, but they didn’t indicate a clinically significant impetus. They did not find evidence of low levels of need satisfaction predicted changes in dysregulated gaming from “normal” psychological-need frustrations, which in general, account for dysregulation and have been observed in other domains such as education and sports. General adolescents’ psychological-need satisfaction and need frustration were associated with both externalizing and internalizing problems. In other words, there were links between psychological needs and dysregulated gaming, but they were considerably smaller than expected, which suggests that an adolescent’s video game dysregulation provides no practical information in the view of a caregiver.

            Limitations for this research include the correlational and self-reported data along with the smaller, localized dataset. Future research should explore which factors of specific games or gamers might affect psychological-need satisfaction through gameplay as well as daily need frustrations amongst a larger pool of participants (i.e. multinational).
