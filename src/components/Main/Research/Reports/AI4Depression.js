            People get sad and upset for a number of reasons. It's helpful to talk to someone who knows how people think and who can help provide insight on how they can get better and happier. As technology gets better, it can help people get better. Technology can act like a person to talk to someone who is sad and upset, and we have some good research showing that this helps people be happier.

            Mental health issues and awareness around these problems has been increasing in the last several decades. As people struggle with their mental issues, they are struggling to find an intervention, e.g. therapist or program, that is accessible, cost-effective, and provides the degree of care that they need individually. Fortunately, there is promising research that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and technological advancements to reach patients in need.

            Using an AI called Tess for 2-4 weeks, participants in a study were able to text a “concerned friend” that helped them during their depressive and anxious moments. Their new friend provided insights, resources, and intervention techniques to combat their depression, and it made a difference on several metrics of personal and emotion well-being.

            AI-assisted interventions show a lot of promise, and we should be investigating more ways to utilize this technology to reach the millions of people that are struggling with depression and related mental health issues.

            A large number of Americans suffer from mental illness of one form or another, specifically college students reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety. A majority of them do not receive adequate health care. Accessibility, cost-effective, and degree of care are all important factors for these patients. This study looks at the use of self-help computer-based cognitive and behavioral interventions, i.e. cognitive behavioral therapy, to reduce a smaller, sub-set of mood disorders experienced by college students, i.e. non-clinical patients.
        </p>
        <p>
            The study consisted of 74 participants who averaged 23 years old with over two-thirds of them female. Participants were put into 1 of 3 groups: an experimental group that used an integrative psychological artificial intelligence&mdash;Tess&mdash;to deliver personalized conversations over 2 weeks via an instant messenger app, a second group that used Tess for 4 weeks, and a control group that was given the National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) eBook. Participants were given a set of questionnaires before and after the experiment windows, which included a health questionnaire, anxiety disorder, positive and negative affect schedule, and satisfaction and engagement during the study.

            Tess is a well developed technology that experienced professionals, i.e. mental health and emotion experts, crafted for use by the broader scientific community. Tess if configurable and works like existing chatbots, but its focus is towards emotional support and mental health interventions. These interventions have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). It is not meant to replace the role of a trained therapist; however, it can deliver a variety of clinically proven therapies, similar to CBT. In this study, Tess delivered intervention techniques rooted in CBT, mindfulness-based therapy, emotionally focused therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, motivational interviewing, self-compassion therapy, and interpersonal psychotherapy, such as journaling and relaxation strategies. Similarly, the control group's NIMH eBook provided similar information and strategies.

            The results show a difference towards reduced symptoms of depression in the experimental and control groups. The findings suggest that Tess was helpful in decreasing depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms, in effecting positive and negative affect schedule (i.e. emotions and feelings) scores, and learning something new about their situation as opposed to the control group. Participant engagement was tracked via messages sent and exchanged, but it was not possible to track the control group's engagement; however, the majority reported being satisfied with the content supplied.

            Participants who interacted with Tess displayed higher levels of engagement and overall satisfaction than those in the control. The researchers note that additional research is recommended before introducing Tess to individuals with clinical levels of depression and anxiety as well as more direct comparisons between the delivery of content coupled with tech-based solutions. The psychological AI used in this study was limited to text conversations only, i.e. it lacked assessment of facial expressions, tone, etc. Additionally, the lack of engagement from the control group, i.e. reading an eBook instead of texting, may have a larger impact on the results and should be assessed.   
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, this study reveals that AI offers a cost-effective and accessible mental health solution that could scale as a complementary tool to traditional treatment methods.
