<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 10%;">I
graduated from the University of South Carolina's Honors College in
2013 with a major in Biology, a minor in Psychology, and a focus in
Educational Gaming. After pursing Medical School and Biomedical
Engineering, I decided to shift my time and energy towards games and
education. During my undergraduate career, I worked on a number of
research projects: </p>

<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 5%;">Through
this
collaborative work with other students, friends, and teachers as well
as a lot of independent reading, I wrote my senior thesis on <a href="interests/Holistic.docx">Holistic Gaming (1.4 MB)</a>:
a game design philosophy that works to understand the physical and
psychological relationship between humans, video games, and video game
play in order to design games that facilitate education, research,
healthcare, and human development. <br>

<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 5%; padding-top: 10px;">I've
been fortunate to grow up playing a variety of games. Back in
Spartanburg, I played competitive (club) soccer for ~11 years with 4
years of high school soccer. I've played intermurals at USC for the
last 6 years, and I joined the International Futbol Club team at USC
for 1 and 1/2 years. I play racquetball, disc golf, and golf when I can
find the time. I've played numerous card games, such as Cards Against
Humanity, poker, and the like, dice games, e.g. Craps, Liars Dice,
etc., and board games, like Risk, Stratego, Chess, Chinese checkers,
and so on. A couple of friends and I invented a drinking board game--<a href="interests/Explosions.html">Explosions in My Pants: A Gentleman's
Game</a>.
And of course video games... So. Many. Video games. Collectively, these
experiences have helped guide me into a field of study that is
challenging, worthwhile, and fun.<br>

<p style="padding: 10px 5% 15px 10%; text-align: left;">Currently,
I am working as a User Experience Designer at The Mariner Group. We are
responsible for designing and developing security technologies for a
number of domains, e.g. maritime ports and harbors, border security,
and airports. We have co-workers across the country, and clients across
the world. We even helped cover security at Nelson Mandela's funeral in
South Africa. We have recently merged with <a href="https://www.arescorporation.com/security/" target="_blank">Ares
Security Corporation</a>,
which offers innovative and effective solutions to plan, detect,
assess,
prevent, and respond to all types of incidents. I enjoy working with
Mariner and Ares because I'm learning how to design pragmatic
technologies for a wide audience of Users. I hope to continue working
with them until I am ready to develop and deploy my holistic video
games. One of my favorite aspects of my job is being able my bike to
work.<br>
