<h3>The Educational Value of Video Games and Video Game Play<br>
</h3>
</div>

<div id="header-container" style="text-align: center;">
<div id="main-content" style="text-align: left;">
<p>Video games are excellent pedagogical tools. As Gentile
reports, video games can provide immediate feedback, motivate players,
set specific goals, promote mastery, encourage distributed learning,
teach for transfer, adapt themselves to the level of the learner, and
provide various other teaching techniques<sup>1</sup>. Whether it&#8217;s
promoting long-term learning through distributed practice or increasing
a player&#8217;s mastery of educational content, various elements of
game-based learning intrinsically provide challenges that develop their
students<sup>1,2</sup>. Additionally, video games train a variety of
mental skills,
such as memory recall and problem solving, that can be implemented in a
number of ways; for example, a video game that teaches players about
the immune system can help solidify immunology-specific information and
can potentially help improve general healthcare practices and
behaviors. There have been a number of video game genres, i.e.
edutainment, children&#8217;s software, and learning games, that have
entwined interactive gaming and entertainment elements to help K-12
students explore the complex dynamics of microworlds, e.g. Sid Meier&#8217;s
Civilization, SimEarth, and Railroad Tycoon<sup>3,4</sup>. More
recently, digital game-based learning (DGBL) is
being incorporated into classrooms to provide specific content, e.g.
teaching history with Civilization, to practice specific skills, e.g.
engineering and management tasks in RollerCoaster Tycoon, and for a
number of other purposes<sup>5</sup>. <br>
<br>
As Boyan and Sherry reveal, game play increases strategic
thinking, cognitive skills, and kinesthetic skills<sup>2</sup>. Through
increased
hand-eye coordination from kinesthetic skills, video game playing
surgeons perform significantly better in laparoscopic surgical skills
than non-video game playing surgeons<sup>2</sup>.
As well, other surgeons&#8212;and the patients they operate on&#8212;could benefit
from exercising and honing specific surgical skills, e.g. operating the
da Vinci Surgical System, neurosurgeons working in the brain, and other
disciplines. Through rigorous training on a video game with similar
controls and actions, doctors could reduce operation time, patient
injuries, and patient fatalities as well as lower overall healthcare
costs for the hospital. Additionally, the military and other
instructional institutions use video game simulators to drill and
practice specific skills, such as training jet pilots<sup>6</sup>. A
study in 2002 by Morgan et al. investigated the success of
simulator-assisted learning vs. video-assisted learning<sup>7</sup>.
Both
educational methods were equal in their educational benefit; however,
students enjoyed the simulator more, and it provided an additional
element of preparing individuals to face real world problems. By
training and learning real world skills through video games and
simulations, we can provide ourselves with better medical,
professional, and cultural care.
<br>
<br>
As an example of a holistic game with educational value, a team and I
have created Immunis. This video game provides pedagogical support
by educating players about a real world phenomenon&#8212;an immune response.
Immunis
is a real-time strategy game where in a player experiences and directs
an immune response. The player controls several leukocytes, i.e. white
blood cells with unique abilities, and defends the body from an
infection. The current version of Immunis pits the player
against an onslaught of bacteria. The player moves from the skin,
through a lymph vessel, to a lymph node, and back to the skin through a
blood vessel. The player controls
macrophages, various types of T and B cells, and other leukocytes.
However, this is only the beginning. Future levels, battles, and
versions will depict various immunological functions, which will
require the player to extensively manipulate and maneuver the immune
system, e.g. bacterial vs. viral infections, how smoking affects the
lungs, immune activation during a prosthetic implant, vaccination,
acne, HIV, and the list goes on.
<br>
<br>
Immunis is designed to educate and entertain teachers, students, and
gamers. The game world reflects a real event in our world, i.e. an
immune response. In order to combat the infection, the player needs to
recruit more white blood cells to fight&#8212;exactly as the immune system
does. As Boyan and Sherry state, &#8220;If designers were to place formal
educational content (e.g. cell physiology rules and affordances) in a
game world as the challenge, players would be more likely to experience
flow and master the content<sup>2</sup>."
Immunis layers these real
and natural processes of the immune system with the intrinsic,
educational elements of video games. Playing Immunis challenges
players to solve cognitive problems relating to the immune system, and
through self-learning and
purposeful play, players develop meaning and knowledge about the immune
system through their actions within the game. Immunis motivates,
provides feedback, and develops problem solving and decision-making
skills&#8212;all of which are responsible for deliberate learning and drive
mastery. The game
teaches players the dynamics and processes of the immune system rather
than focus on names and terminology; however, if the player chooses,
s/he can delve further into the educational experience by visiting
Immunis&#8217; website and Immunary&#8212;an in-game log of terms and definitions.
To provide a more natural feel, Immunis does not posses a user
interface like traditional games; so, the player simply interacts with
the microenvironment according to realistic events and processes, such
as phagocytosis, chemical gradients, and antigen recognition.
