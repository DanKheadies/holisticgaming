<h3>A Complete Systems Learning Game</h3>
<h4>One Game to rule them all,<br>
One Game to find them,<br>
One Game to bring them all,<br>
And in the darkness, mind them.</h4>

<p>A complete systems learning game is designed to
inform and train people about the natural world through a virtual
world. It is a video game that educates the player about every system,
process, and phenomenon that
occurs in our natural world. Since the game is based off reality, it
encompasses various components, mechanisms, and aspects of the
natural world, e.g. biological, chemical, historical, societal, and
political systems. As the player navigates the world, s/he sees objects
or &#8216;stories&#8217; to
interact with and play through. Each object or story, e.g. an oak tree,
is unique in its gameplay, i.e. how the player interacts with the
environment and what the player experiences and learns. Yet, it
combines these games and stories with other objects and stories in the
world to create the experience of &#8220;life." Any event, experience, or
process that occurs in the natural world is subject to be a game, e.g.
a plant performing photosynthesis, an immune reaction in the body, a
sound wave as it passes through the air, wind currents, windmills,
corporation management, world affairs, relationships, epidemics, and
exponentially more; any topic&#8212;broad or specific&#8212;can be used by the game
to educate people, such as history, chemistry, nutrition and food,
sports, music, natural disasters, marine biomes, state law, and the
list goes on. If it can happen in the real world, it can happen in
the game, and gamers learn by playing through each phenomenon and
process. In essence, the player
works through personal challenges in the form of various games, which
reveal him or her as part of greater ecology, history, and society.
<br>
<br>
To understand a complete systems learning game in another perspective,
imagine numerous mini-games
that create a larger, more involved game. These mini-games are
distinctly
different, but they intertwine to create a unified experience, e.g.
Mario Party. As Green and Bavelier point out, &#8220;variety is an
essential characteristic of training regimens that lead to more general
learning,"<sup>1</sup> and a complete systems learning game will
contain a lot of variety
regarding content and game play styles. The player learns these laws
and how the world works
through the game play. For example, the player starts off as an apple
tree&#8212;growing from a seed to a fruitful tree as a puzzle game. Then, the
game shifts to a person plucking an apple and eating it, wherein the
player travels with the apple to the human
consuming it. The player then learns how it gets broken down and
converted into energy through an action, racing game. Finally, the game
changes to a real-time strategy game where the player controls the
immune system and fights off an infection caused by the apple, similar
to Immunis. Additionally, the
player&#8217;s success in the game reflects the game experience, i.e. the
better s/he does in the game world, the more the game world opens
up to him or her with new and harder games, stories, and the like.
<br>
<br>
The idea is to immerse players into the experience through both
software, i.e. the game play, and hardware, i.e. glove controllers. The
gloves would contain buttons and joysticks to allow the &#8220;controller&#8221; to
remain a part of the game. Additionally, there would be a motion sensor
control that allows players to manipulate and control the
environment&#8212;literally with their hands. By moving the gloves in a
particular fashion, an action would correspond in the game, such as
picking up objects, cranking a wheel, drawing a line with a finger,
writing sentences with a stylus, flying around, hunting down prey,
building elaborate systems, and the possibilities go on. Players could
play individual games as well as with other players around the world in
cooperative and competitive games.<br>
<br>
Under a holistic perspective, a complete systems learning game
redefines education. Through the
systematic and scientific analysis of the game and its effects,
the game provides instrumental and intelligible results that work on
various levels&#8212;physical, psychological, educational, meta-cognitive,
and many more. Gamers will learn from the game, i.e. educational value.
Scientists will learn from the gamers, i.e. research tools. Designers
will learn form the scientists, i.e. future games that facilitate
research, education, and prevention/treatment stratagems. And humanity
will learn from the collective. We have the ability to create games
that entertain and educate. We need to provide ourselves with the best
opportunities for success in this world, and holistic gaming serves as
a valuable catalyst for that change. <br>
