<h3>Video games and video game play create an ideal environment for
learning. They present information in a variety of ways, scale in
difficulty and complexity, and are customizable for a number of
physical
and cognitive disabilities. Video games and video game play create a
personal and meaningful experience that engages and motivates learners
to interact with the information presented to them.</h3>

Humans have played games for thousands of years<sup>1</sup>. Through
natural events and environmental influences, games and play have
affected
humans physically and mentally, and they continue to affect us today<sup>1</sup>.
From physical
sports like the Olympics to mental challenges like solitare, games and
play have entwined with our society and culture<sup>1</sup>. Across the
world, people of all ages play games for a variety of reasons, and as
humans grow and develop, games and play develop too.
Within this last century, humans have transformed games and play into
video
games and video game play. These technological advancements come in
many shapes, colors, and flavors. They are played on computers, in
arcades,
on consoles, and mobile devices with various types of inputs and outputs<sup>2,3</sup>.
These
technological
innovations make our world fun, frustrating, and full of potential.
Several fields--education, medicine, business--are incorporating gamic
properties as well as video games into their practices because play and
video game play are enjoyable, biologically encouraged, provide
immediate feedback, and they motivate exploration and learning<sup>1,3,4,5</sup>.
This relationship between games and play affects several areas in the
brain:<sup>6,7,8,9</sup>
<ul class="bullets">
  <li> Sensory (or Recognition) Regions</li>
  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>the visual cortex</li>
    <li>the auditory cortex</li>
    <li>the somatosensory cortex</li>
  </ul>
  <li style="padding-top: 7px;">Decision and Execution (or Strategy)
Regions</li>
  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>the premotor cortex</li>
    <li>the motor cortex</li>
    <li>the prefrontal cortex<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li style="padding-top: 7px;">Reward Centers of the Brain (or
Affective Networks)</li>
  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>the basal ganglia</li>
    <li>the limbic system</li>
    <li>structures in the medial forebrain circuit</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
Since individuals vary in physical and psychological abilities,
learners recognize information differently, they respond and
solve problems differently, and they have different levels of
engagement and motivation<sup>10</sup>. Video games and video game play
provide a
flexible approach to learning because their content and controls can be
customized for individual needs. If a person's learning is limited by
serious conditions, i.e. a mental disability or <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZS5Da8r.jpg" alt="The Beauty of Gaming">
physical aliment</a>, video games can be designed and integrated with <a href="http://webaim.org/articles/motor/assistive" alt="Assisitve 
Technology">assistive, adaptive, or rehabilitative
techonology</a>. For example, individuals that struggle with
attention and focusing tasks can train these abilities with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S26Kk-ueWjQ" alt="Video Game 
Neurofeedback">video game neurofeedback</a>, which
intergrates and connects elements within the
game, such as speed or power, to neurological frequencies emitted by
the player<sup>11</sup>.
If a person's abilities are
limited by their environment, such as social isolation or a lack of
purpose, play and video game play can 'turn on' players by facilitating
learner involvement, direction, and drive. As a few examples, video
games are used to create and optimize professional skills such as
learning accouting, economic, and business lessons in World of
Warcraft; video games are used in classrooms to personalize course
material in a 'hands-on' experience, like playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gbmjZ1i8Sg" alt="Escape to Morrow
with Minecraft">Minecraft</a>
to teach students different styles of governance, learn
how to negotiate, and to develop social skills; and gamic elements are
being used
to provide students with feedback, motivation, and engagment, such as
through <a href="http://www.classcraft.com/en/" alt="ClassCraft and Quest-Based Learning">quest-based learning</a>
(see images below). Through innovations like these, society will be
able to develop video games and use video game play to facilitate
education, provide prevention and treatment for a number of
disabilities, train professionals, and as research to continue to
understand humans.<br>
