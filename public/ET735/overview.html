<p style="padding-left: 4.2%;">Video games are media-rich tools that
make learning more accessible for individuals with cognitive
disabilities.
</p>
</div>
<div id="main">
<p>Video games and video game play make learning more accessible by
presenting information in multiple ways, providing several ways to plan
and perform tasks, and by motivating and engaging players. This style
of learning facilitates all types of learners, and individuals with
cognitive disabilities can use video game play to treat and train their
mental deficiencies. A person with a cognitive disability has
difficulty using mental abilities to execute mental tasks, such as
sustaining attention, remembering information, comprehending text, and
so on. Cognitive disabilities range in severity and diagnosis, and in
order to be effective, treatment needs to affect both neurological
structures as well as psychological behaviors<sup>1</sup>. Fortunately,
video
games affect physical and cognitive domains, and they are flexible and
sophisticated enough to accommodate an array of cognitive disabilities.<br>
<br>
Video games are media-rich tools that provide equal opportunities for
players to train and develop mental abilities. Video games present
information in a number of ways:
<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Visual and auditory cues</li>
  <li>Repeatable experiences</li>
  <li>Logs and menus</li>
  <li>Short-term objectives and long-term goals</li>
  <li>Stories and adventures</li>
  <li>Real-time action vs. turn-based strategy</li>
  <li>Scalable difficulty</li>
  <li>Individual and multiplayer game play</li>
  <li>Competition and cooperation</li>
  <li>And in other various ways</li>
</ul>
<p>Video games and video game play make information interactive, which
allows a player to recognize and understand that information in a
personal way. Players learn, plan, and execute physical and mental
tasks in order to achieve goals and objectives. Each action in a video
game is coupled with immediate feedback, and this feedback promotes
deliberate learning and mastery towards the task at hand<sup>2</sup>.
Video game
play is naturally challenging and rewarding, and video games engage and
motivate players to invest time and energy in that video game play
experience<sup>3,4,5,6</sup>. By using these innate characteristics of
video
games, we can entice players to exercise and train cognitive skills,
which can help treat a number of cognitive disabilities<sup>7</sup>.
<br>
<br>
By nature or by nurture, some individuals possess limited or severely
limited cognitive abilities. A number of neurological and behavior
factors contribute to clinical conditions, such as attention deficit
disorder (ADD), severe clinical conditions, like traumatic brain injury
(TBI), and functional disabilities that deal with specific cognitive
domains, such as memory deficits<sup>7</sup>. Cognitive disabilities
can be broken
down into functional components that define an individual's
limitations, and we can train those limitations through video games and
video game play.
<br>
<br>
Cognition is defined as the mental processes associated with memory,
language, perception, attention, and problem solving, decision-making,
and reasoning<sup>8</sup>. Cognition develops through bottom-up and
top-down
processes. The bottom-up process is input and data driven, which
involves perceiving the world, remembering features and characteristics
about it, and navigating the environment. The top-down process applies
previously learned knowledge to affect perception, memory, problem
solving, decision-making, and the like<sup>8</sup>. Video game play
challenges
these process and drives cognitive development. Through a cyclical flow
of bottom-up and top-down processing, a player perceives and interacts
with the video game environment--processing bottom-up--and in order to
succeed in the game, s/he must solve problems and use several cognitive
skills to overcome obstacles and challenges--processing top-down.
<br>
<br>
Multiple observations report cognitive growth from video game
play<sup>9,10,11,12,13</sup>. This supports the idea that video games
train and
develop cognitive abilities, and video game play can provide a
treatment as well as prevention option to cognitive disabilities. I
purpose that we can study the affect of video game play on cognitive
domains, and through extensive research, we can design video game
systems to accommodate cognitive needs at an individual level. In order
to do that, I will investigate and experiment with a holistic game:
Immunis. Immunis is a real-time strategy game where in a player
experiences and directs an immune response. The player controls several
leukocytes, i.e. white blood cells with unique abilities, and defends
the body from an infection. As a holistic game, Immunis will:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Provide educational value and pedagogical support for immunology
specific information</li>
  <li>Help prevent illnesses, e.g. lung cancer, by making the player
cognizant of how these illnesses arise as well as the damage they cause</li>
  <li>Assess cognitive growth and development</li>
</ol>
