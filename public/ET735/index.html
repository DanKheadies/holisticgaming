<p style="padding-left: 4.2%;">Video games are media-rich tools that
make learning more accessible for individuals with cognitive
disabilities.</p>
</div>
<div><a name="overview" style="position: relative; top: -50px;"></a>

<div id="main">
<h3>Overview</h3>
Video games and video game play make learning more accessible by<sup>1</sup>:
<ul>
  <li>Presenting information in a variety of ways</li>
  <li>Providing several ways to plan and perform tasks</li>
  <li>And by motivating and engaging players</li>
</ul>
This style
of learning facilitates all types of learners, and it is
especially helpful for individuals dealing with physical and cognitive
disabilities. A person with a cognitive disability has
difficulty using mental abilities to execute mental tasks, such as
sustaining attention, remembering information, comprehending text, and
so on. Cognitive disabilities range in severity and diagnosis, and in
order to be effective, treatment needs to affect both neurological
structures as well as psychological behaviors<sup>2</sup>.
Fortunately,
video games affect physical and cognitive domains, and they are
flexible and sophisticated enough to accommodate an array of cognitive
disabilities. I am designing a video game, Immunis, that trains various
mental abilities.
<div><a name="design" style="position: relative; top: -50px;"></a></div>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Naturally Designed for Universal Learning</h3>
Games and play are naturally designed for learners of any age,
ethnicity, or intelligence. Games contain goals, rules, challenges,
feedback, voluntary participation, and result in a quantifiable
outcome<sup>3,4,5</sup>. Video games are a complex form of
digital
media that incorporates these gamic properties, and as a media-rich
tool, video games provide equal opportunities for players to train and
develop mental abilities. Video games present information in a number
of ways:
<ul>
  <li>Visual and auditory cues</li>
  <li>Repeatable experiences</li>
  <li>Logs and menus</li>
  <li>Short-term objectives and long-term goals</li>
  <li>Stories and adventures</li>
  <li>Real-time action vs. turn-based strategy</li>
  <li>Scalable difficulty</li>
  <li>Individual and multiplayer game play</li>
  <li>Competition and cooperation</li>
  <li>And in other various ways</li>
</ul>
Video games and video game play make information interactive, which
allows a player to recognize and understand that information in a
personal way (Figure 1 - Column 1). Players learn, plan, and execute
physical and mental tasks in order to achieve goals and objectives.
Each action in a video game is coupled with immediate feedback, and
this feedback promotes deliberate learning and mastery towards the task
at hand<sup>6</sup> (Figure 1 - Column 2). Video game
play is naturally challenging and rewarding, and video games engage and
motivate players to invest time and energy in that video game play
experience<sup>7,8,9,10</sup> (Figure 1 - Column 3). By using
these
innate characteristics of video games, we can entice players to
exercise and train cognitive skills, which can help treat a number of
cognitive disabilities<sup>1</sup>.

<br>
<br>
<h3>Cognition</h3>
Cognition is defined as the mental processes associated with memory,
language, perception, attention, problem solving, decision-making,
and reasoning<sup>11</sup>. Cognition develops through bottom-up and
top-down processes (Figure 2). The bottom-up process is input and data
driven, which
involves perceiving the world, remembering features and characteristics
about it, and navigating the environment. The top-down process applies
previously learned knowledge to affect perception, memory, problem
solving, decision-making, and the like<sup>11</sup>. Video game play
challenges these processes and drives cognitive development. Through a
cyclical flow
of bottom-up and top-down processing, a player perceives and interacts
with the video game environment--processing bottom-up--and in order to
succeed in the game, s/he must solve problems and use several cognitive
skills to overcome obstacles and challenges--processing top-down.

neurons (bottom circles) that 'talk' to more neurons. Information is
stored between these connections. Thinking (top circles) activates and
controls that information.</i>
</div>
</div>
<br>
According to the CHC theory of cognitive abilities, human cognition
exists on three levels or stratum<sup>12,13</sup>. The largest,
most
encompassing level is the General stratum, or <i>g</i>, which
represents a person's general intelligence. The next level down is the
Broad stratum, which includes 9+ clusters of cognitive abilities. The
lowest level is the Narrow stratum, which includes 70+ cognitive
abilities. Different theories and psychometeric tests identify Broad
and Narrow abilities differently<sup>7,14,15,16</sup>.
Following the
Woodcock-Johnson III - Tests of Cognitive Abilities, there are 7 Broad
clusters and a number of Narrow abilities that can be tested and
analyzed. They include<sup>15,16</sup>:
<br>
<ol>
  <li><b>Crystallized Intelligence</b> or <b>Comprehension-Knowledge</b>
(<i>Gc</i>): the breadth and depth of one's acquired knowledge; how
well one reasons and communicates that knowledge</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Declarative knowledge</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Factual information</li>
      <li>Comprehension</li>
      <li>Rules</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Procedural knowledge</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Operational skills</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Fluid Reasoning</b> (<i>Gf</i>): the ability to reason, form
concepts, and solve problems using novel information and procedures</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Inductive reasoning</li>
    <li>Deductive reasoning</li>
    <li>Identifying relationships</li>
    <li>Drawing inferences</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Short-Term Memory</b> (<i>Gsm</i>): the ability to
perceive and hold information in immediate awarness and use it within a
few seconds</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Memory span</li>
    <li>Working memory</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Long-Term Retrieval</b> (<i>Glm</i>): the ability
to store information as well as retrieve and use that information while
thinking</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Associative memory</li>
    <li>Meaningful memory</li>
    <li>Associative fluency</li>
    <li>Naming facility</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Visual-Spatial Thinking</b> or <b>Visual
Processing</b> (<i>Gv</i>): the ability to perceive, analyze,
synthesize, and discriminate visual patterns as well as store and
recall visual representations</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Mentally manipulate objects and patterns</li>
    <li>Identify obscure or vague representations</li>
    <li>Visual memory</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Auditory Processing</b> (<i>Ga</i>): the
ability to analyze, synthesize, and discriminate auditory stimuli as
well as discern speech sounds</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Discriminate speech sounds</li>
    <li>Discriminate tones</li>
    <li>Temporally track auditory events</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Processing Speed</b> (<i>Gs</i>): the
ability to perform automatic cognitive tasks (for ~2-3 minutes) while
sustaining focused attention</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Perceptual speed</li>
    <li>Rate-of-test-taking</li>
    <li>Associative fluency</li>
    <li>Naming facility</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
There are more Broad and Narrow abilities, and this list provides an
example of various cognitive domains that can be tested, analyzed, and
understood. <br>
<br>
By nature and by nurture, some individuals possess limited or severely
limited cognitive abilities. A number of neurological and behavior
factors contribute to clinical conditions such as attention deficit
disorder (ADD), severe clinical conditions like traumatic brain injury
(TBI), and functional disabilities that deal with specific cognitive
domains such as memory deficits<sup>1</sup>. These individuals are
mentally limited in specific ways, and their treatment typically ranges
from pharmalogical medication to behavioral therapy. By affecting both
physical and psychological processes, video games and video game play
act as a form of prevention and treatment for cognitive growth.
Multiple observations report
cognitive and physical changes from video game play<sup>9,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25</sup>,
and
supports the idea that video games train and develop cognitive
abilities, and video game play provides a treatment as well as
prevention option to cognitive disabilities. As researchers and
designers learn how video game
elements and architectures train Broad and Narrow cognitive abilities,
individuals with cognitive disabilities will be able to receive
treatment through video game play.

<h3>Immunis - a Holistic Game</h3>
I purpose that we can study the affect of video game play on cognitive
domains, and through extensive research, we can design video game
systems to accommodate cognitive needs at an individual level. In order
to do that, I will investigate and experiment with a <a href="http://66.147.244.111/%7Eimmunisg/ET703/VideoGames/HolisticGaming.html" title="Holistic Gaming definition">holistic game</a>:
Immunis. Immunis is a strategy game where in a player
experiences and directs an immune response. The player controls several
leukocytes, i.e. white blood cells with unique abilities, and defends
the body from an infection. This is a video of Immunis:

<div class="imageText">
<i>Video 1: Immunis 0.0 Stage 1</i>
</div>
<br>
<br>
As a holistic game, Immunis will:
<ol>
  <li>Provide educational value and pedagogical support for immunology
specific information</li>
  <li>Help prevent illnesses, e.g. lung cancer, by making the player
cognizant of how these illnesses arise as well as the damage they cause</li>
  <li>Assess cognitive growth and development</li>
</ol>

    <li>Staiano and Calvert reveal that physically intense video games
like exergames, e.g. Dance Dance Revolution and Wii Sports, are being
used as health tools to increase caloric expenditure and heart rate.
Also, using video games as a form of aerobic exercise affects the
structure and function of the brain in a number of ways: It increases
cerebral circulation via enhanced cardiorespiratory functioning, and it
also decreases the risk of disease by providing an enriched environment
of increased neurotransmitters, enhanced physiological and neurological
mechanisms, and healthy molecular and neurochemical changes.
Collectively, these changes can lead to improved physical and cognitive
performance, social interaction, and academic performance.</li>
